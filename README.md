# djanvaslms

A Django layer on top of Canvas LMS (Learning Management System)
- Uses the Canvas API to get information from Canvas into Django
- Goals:
  - scratch the itch: learn about Django by playing around with it
  - facilitate new educational apps
  - provide students of software engineering and data science a
    practical opportunity to get their hands dirty
  - use programming and devops as the primary LMS user interface
    rather than the standard Canvas web interface
  - make use of Canvas's open api, and incredibly valuable feature
  
## Current Status: *under development*
